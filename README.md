# Value Iteration, Policy Evaluation:

In this assignment, we wanted to apply value iteration algorithm of Dynamic programming on several probelms and see how the convergence is achieved.

##MAZE PROBLEM

We have written a program, that given the starting point and goal point in a maze of arbitrary size, by value iteartion we find a path from starting to goal point.
Example 5* 5 maze:
